Most often, this type of gift exchange takes place at a party with other participants in attendance.</p>

                <p>In a Norse Pig gift exchange, each participant brings a wrapped, unmarked gift and places it in a designated area. Guests are given numbers as they arrive, or their names are randomly drawn, and they select gifts in that order — with a twist.</p>
                <p>On the first turn, the person assigned with #1 picks out a gift and opens it so all can see what it is. On the second turn, the person assigned with #2 gets the choice of “stealing” #1’s unwrapped gift or choosing a wrapped one from the pile. If #2 steals #1’s gift, then #1 must choose and open a wrapped gift.</p>
                <p>As subsequent players take their turns, they either select a new gift or take any already opened gift from any of the other players. Have any player who has a gift taken away either choose a new gift or take an already-opened gift from another player.</p>
                <p>The game continues with the following rules:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>If someone steals your gift, you can steal someone else’s gift or choose and open a wrapped one.</li>
                <li>Continue until everyone has had a turn for a gift. A turn is ended when an unopened gift has been opened.</li>
                <li>A gift can only be “stolen” once during a turn. If a gift is taken from someone during one round, she cannot take it back during that same round. She can, however, take it back in a later round if she is in a position to select a gift.</li>
                <li>A gift cannot be immediately stolen back from the player who just stole it.</li>
                <li>Once a gift has 3 “owners,” the 3rd owner of a gift gets to keep it – it is retired and can’t be stolen again.</li>
                <li>The gift exchange ends when the last wrapped gift is chosen and opened.</li>
                <li>After the last turn, the person who started (since she didn’t get a chance at the beginning) can put back the gift and “steal” a gift according to the rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This starts the gift exchange again (following the above rules) and ends when someone chooses or is forced to take the gift given up by the person with #1.</p>
